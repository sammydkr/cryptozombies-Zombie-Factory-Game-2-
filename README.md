# cryptozombies-Zombie-Factory-Game-2-
We've added a way to update our CryptoKitties contracts
We've learned to protect core functions with onlyOwner
We've learned about gas and gas optimization
We added levels and cooldowns to our zombies
We now have functions to update a zombie's name and DNA once the zombie gets above a certain level
And finally, we now have a function to return a user's zombie army
